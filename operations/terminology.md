## Tactics

### Target 
1. A potentially hostile enemy. 
    - Used to note a hostile in a particular bearing/range from the unit.

### Contact 
1. An enemy unit which is engaging friendlies.
    - Contact is the natural progression of a target who has become hostile to the unit or friendlies. 

### A.D.D.
1. Alert, Direction, Distance
    - A quick verbal warning given to all members, usually over a radio indicating a hostile contact spotted. 
    - Examples:
        - "4 man patrol, 1-6-5, 100 meters moving toward us!"
        - "2 technicals, 2-8-3, 500 meters and closing!"
        - "Contact! Squad, East, distance close!" 
    - Key points:
        - Don't use "to my right" or "behind me". These terms are confusing to a group. Use cardinal directions, or bearings. Whichever is more appropriate. 
        - Convey via appropriate medium. If you are near everyone who would be able to engage, yell through local voice. If your entire squad is spread out, use radio.
        - In the event contact is called out, everyone should relay that callout in local chat to everyone near them. 

### 360 Degree Security 
1. A concept in which everyone in the unit covers a direction around the units space.
    - This ensures no unseen hostiles can sneak up and compromise the unit's security.

### Rules of Engagement 
1. Rules defining the who/what/when/where/why of how combat will be conducted by BLUFOR. 
    - Without specific briefs, ROE should be that targets should meet the threat triangle before engagement.

### Threat Triangle 
1. A set of three rules denoting if a unit can be engaged.
    - A target must have capability (They possess a weapon).
    - A target must have the ability (Their weapon can cause harm to you at their engagement range).
    - A target must have intent (They must show their intent by actively attempting to point/raise the weapon at you or friendlies).

## Navigation

### Waypoint
1. A specific location in the Area of Operations which the unit is supposed to travel through. 
    - Set generally at mission start and dynamically as needed. 

### Rallypoint
1. A specific location understood by all team members as being the fallback point should everything go wrong. 
    - Set generally at mission start and dynamically as needed.

### Vehicle Rallypoint
1. A location where a convoy pre-determines to disembark from vehicles to continue a patrol on foot.
    - Typically out of audio range of targets and in a concealed location.
