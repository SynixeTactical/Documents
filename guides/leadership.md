## Leadership Roles & Responsibilities
Operation Lead - The Operation Lead (OL) is responsible for the planning and execution of the entire operation. This role is Equivalent to a Platoon Commander/Squad Leader in other groups in terms of responsibility. The OL's job is to ensure overarching objectives are met, and the safety of the entire Squad is maintianed. The OL accomplishes this through delegation of orders to the EL's throughout the op. While the EL's handle tactical control and movements, the OL will exercise more of a high level tactical control over the unit. Examples of this macro tactical control include:
- Defining objectives
- Defining macro tactical positions for the Elements (For example, telling Bravo they are to position due East of a road while Alpha is positioned due West)

Element Lead - The Element Lead (EL) is responsible for the employment of his/her Element. The Element is a smaller unit size, consisting of up to 4 teams, with 2 personnel each for a total of 8 contractors.  The EL is responisble for the employment of his Element at a more tactical level. Where the OL will define overarching objectives, and macro tactics like defining where Elements should be in an engagement, the EL will exercise tactical control. Tactical control would be things like;
- Spacing between members.
- Establishing bases of fire
- Employment of special weapons.
The EL will exercise his tactical control to carry out the OL's orders. The EL will accomplish this by delegating tasks to his Team Leaders (TL).

## Typical Structure

## Formation Basics
As a leader, part of the knowledge you're expected to posess will be the types of formations and their employment scenarios. The following types are all useful in different situations:
- Column - A straight line in the direction of travel. Easiest to maintain, quick, and versatile.
    - Pros: Provides good sectors of fire to the right and left, most manueverable through difficult terrain.
    - Cons: Trouble shifting base of fire to the front/rear during contact.
- Staggered Column - A straight line in the direction of travel. The difference is however each member of the line is offset either 5 meters to the right, or 5 meters to the left. Provides the same versatility as a column, with a bit more spacing.
    - Pros: Useful in cities, walking down roads. 
    - Cons: Poor ability to shift entire base of fire left or right, still quite exposed from front/rear contact.
- Line - Like a column, but instead being a straight line in the direction of travel, its perpendicular to the direction of travel. 
    - Pros: Good front/rear coverage for base of fire, can cover a wide area.
    - Cons: Poor coverage of fire to the left/right of the squad, poor manueverability/control in anything but a flat open environment.
- Echelon (Left/Right) - Like a line, but canted to the left or right. A diagonal line. 
    - Pros: Mix of coverage front and to the sides. 
    - Cons: Poor manueverability/control.
- Wedge - Imagine two echelon's coming together at a single point in the middle with troops trailing back to the left and right, it should look like an arrow point from the top down. 
    - Pros: Superb ability to establish a solid base of fire front and rear, while lacking on sides, easier to shift base of fire. 
    - Cons: Manueverability is poor in difficult terrain (mountainous areas, jungles)
- V - Imagine the opposite of a Wedge. A walking V heading in the direction of travel.
    - Pros: Superb intersection of fire ahead. Otherwise same benefits from the Wedge. Very useful during a fighting retreat when trying to attempt a hasty hambush.
    - Cons: Manueverability is still low in tough terrain.


## OSMEAC Briefings

### Leadership Tips
The following are some important to know leadership points that can help you in your quest of accomplishing the missions and developing your personnel.
- Praise in public, scrold in private.
- An okay decision now, is better than a perfect decision ten minutes from now.
    - In the heat of the moment. You don't have the luxury to make decisions forever. Sometimes you need to act. Freezing gets your ream killed. 
- No plan survives first contact.
- Murphy's Law is a bitch. 
    - Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. 
- Recon is your friend. Knowing is half the battle. 

**MOST IMPORTANTLY:**
- Everyone messes up. Don't worry so much about screwing up, because you're bound to. Learn from it, and adjust in the future.
