# Grenadier Guide

## Role Description

A grenadier is primarily a standard operator, and is not considered a specialized role. A grenadier is expected to be able to carry out all the responsibilities of a standard operator.

## Specialized Equipment

Completing the certification for Grenadier will unlock the ability to purchase and operate weapons with an Underslung Grenade Launcher (UGL). The UGL is a support weapon that should only be used in the appropriate situations. It is capable of firing launchable payloads accurately up to 400m.

## Usage

### Callouts

Similar to throwing a grenade, every time you discharge a UGL a call should be made over proximity voice. The call should be in the format:

> [Count] [Round] out. [Direction] [Distance]

Examples

> HE Out. North. 150m.

> 2 HE Out. 1-6-0. 200m.

> 1 Smoke Out. South-East. 100m.

The call out should not slow down your ability to respond to threats. At a minimum you must always call out "HE Out".

### Risks of Use

When firing HE Rounds you need to know the impact radius and fragmentation of the
round to maximize injury on the enemy and reduce friendly injuries.

The approximate lethality of an HE Round is:

- 5m - Deadly
- 25m - Serious Injury
- 50m - Minor Injury
- 100m - Safe

Regardless of range there is always a chance of being hit by a piece of shrapnel.

#### Vehicles

Civilian and unarmored vehicles can be disabled with 1 or 2 hits from an UGL to the engine or body. Most wheels can be destroyed with a single UGL hit. UGL HE rounds are ineffective against armoured targets, but can be effective against dismounting personnel.

#### Danger Close

UGL HE rounds should not be fired within 150m of friendly units to avoid incidental blue-on-blue.

#### Civilian Environments

Due to the wide range of UGL HE rounds, they should not be used when civilians are within 500m of the target.

### Ammo Types

- HE (High Explosive)
  - Also known as "40 mil" or "40 Mike Mike"
  - Minimum fuse range of 15 meters.

- Smoke
  - Deploys 2 seconds after being fired
  - Lasts 60 seconds

- Flare
  - Deploys 3 seconds after being fired
  - Lasts 25 seconds
  - Max range of 250m regardless of range used

### Travel Time

UGL fired projectiles travel at 80 m/s, slowing down over time.

| Distance (Meters) | Time (Seconds) |
|-------------------|----------------|
| 50                | 0.6            |
| 75                | 0.9            |
| 100               | 1.2            |
| 150               | 1.8            |
| 200               | 2.5            |
| 250               | 3.1            |
| 300               | 3.7            |
| 350               | 4.3            |
| 400               | 5              |
