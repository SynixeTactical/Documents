# Medic

## Role Description

The Medic is in-charge of providing advanced aid to patients beyond what a rifeman is capable of. The Medic is an exclusive role and is not capable of acting as another special role during a mission.

## Specialized Equipment

* Surgical Kit: Used to permanently close bandaged wounds, applies to all limbs. Duration is increased with the amount of wounds
* Morphine: Lowers Blood Pressure & Heart Rate & Greatly Suppressed Pain
* Pain Killers: Suppressed pain to a lesser extent of Morphine
* Epinephrine: Raises Heart Rate
* Adenosine: Lowers Heart Rate
* Pulse Oximitter: Monitors Heart Rate and SPO2 and can be attached to limbs
* Saline IV (1000/500/250ml): Used to transfuse fluids to raise Blood Pressure
* Chest Seal: Treats a Pneumothorax in the torso


## UI

As covered in [Combat Aid](guides/combataid.md) the UI layout remains the same, with a few additional options under each tab; those will be covered in this section.

### Examine Patient
* You will now have access to the **Attach Pulse Oximiter** while on a valid limb
* **Check Pulse** and **Check Blood Pressure** now return accurate readings

### Medication
* You will now be able to administer **Morphine**, **Adenosine**, and **Epinephrine** to limbs

### Advanced Treatments
* You will be able to **Use Surgical Kit** to stitch the patients wounds


## MIST Report

The MIST report is taught to all riflemen as part of Combat Aid, it is used to quickly convey the status of a patient to the medic on site.

* Mechanism: What was the cause of injury; Speed, Mass, Height, Restraints, Number/Type of collisions, Weapon Type
* Injuries: What injuries have been caused; Backblast, Grenade, Bullet Wounds, etc.
* Symptoms and Vitals: Current status of the patient; Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Airways, etc.
* Treatments: What aid has been applied; Bandages, Tourniquet, Splints, etc.

> This information should be relayed to any other Medics performing medical on the patient.

## General Procedure

Providing aid should follow the ABCs, being Airway, Breathing, Circulation.
* Airway: Performing [Airway Management](###airway-management) to control SPO2
* Breathing: Ensure airways are clear and SPO2 remains at 100. Can be monitored with Pulse Oximiter
* Circulation: Follow [Treating Patient](###treating-patient) and perform [Wound Treatment](###wound-treatment)



### Locating Patient

The primary focus of a Medic is finding who is priority in need of assistance and providing aid, this can be done by:
* The patient calling for help
* A bystander calls that the patient needs help
* Your objective is to treat a patient
* You personally saw the injured patient

Once a patient has been identified you should:
* Ask for location of the patient if not known
* Ask for a [MIST report](###mist-report) on the patient if you are not first to administer aid

### Treating Patient

1. Is the patient responsive?

 Yes: Ask them for their wounds and pain, then act accordingly
 
 No: Proceed to step 2.


2. Does the patient have a pulse?â€™

 Yes: Continue to step 3.

 No: If alone provide CPR, if wounds are not critical. If someone else is present, have them perform CPR while treating wounds and stitching.

3. Are airways obstructed/occluded?

 Yes: Perform [Airway Management](###airway-management)

 No: Continue to step 4

4. Is the patient wounded?

 Yes: Treat the wounds and apply tourniquets to the limbs if multiple limbs are wounded. Do not leave a tourniquet on a limb for longer than 5 minutes.
 
 No: Continue to step 4

5. Did the patient lose a large amount of blood?
 
 Yes: Transfuse saline accordingly, covered in [Vitals](###vitals)
 
 No: Continue to step 5

6. Is the patient awake?
 
 Yes: Treat any fractures with splits and continue to step 6
 
 No: Stabilize Heart Rate and Blood Pressure, monitor patient until awoken. If urgent, and patient is stable, administer one shot of Epinephrine

7. Is the patient in pain?
 
 Yes: If stable and in severe pain needing immediate relief: Give Morphine
 
 Yes: Not stable and/or not needing immediate relief: Give Painkillers
 
 No: Continue to next patient


## Airway Management

* Check patient airways (Check Airways)
    * The airway can be in one of three states:
        * No Obstruction, No Occlusion
        * Obstructed, no Occlusion
        * Obstructed, Occluded
    * If **Airway Management Is Needed/Occluded** a guedel tube must be inserted
    * A guedel tube cannot be inserted if airways are **Obstructed**, if so the head must be turned (Head Turning) until the obstruction is removed

Airway management is the highest priority and should be monitored constantly. The patient will often audibly make a vomiting noise when the airways become **Obstructed**.



## Wounds

### Wound Type

* Abrasions/Scrapes: Friction against a rough surface; Vehicle collision or falling
* Avulsions: Major structure removed by force; Large caliber gunshot wound
* Contusions/Bruises: Forceful trauma to internal structure without breaking skin
* Crushes: Skin has been slit and caused tearing to unlying structurel; Falling or vehicle collisions
* Cuts: Slicing wounds that produce even edges; Shrapnel or explosions
* Lacerations/Tears: Slicing wounds producing ragged edges; Vehicle collisions or falling
* Velocity: Small objects entering the body at high speeds; Bullets or shrapnel
* Punctures: Deep, narrow wounds produced by sharp objects; Knives or shrapnel
* Pneumothorax (Torso Only): Collapsed lung: Bullets, shrapnel


### Wound Treatment

#### Bandages

There are **three** types of bandages available for use:
* Packing: Average efficiency to bandage wounds with quick time for wounds to reopen
* Elastic: Above average efficiency to bandage wounds with quick time for wounds to reopen
* Quick Clot: Slightly below average efficiency with the slowest times to reopen wounds
* Chest Seal: While not a bandage, it is needed to treat a Pneumothorax

It is recommended to begin by applying a Quick Clot followed by Elastic bandages


#### Injectors and Medicine

* Morphine: Lowers Blood Pressure & Heart Rate & Greatly Suppressed Pain
* Pain Killers: Suppressed pain to a lesser extent of Morphine
* Epinephrine: Raises Heart Rate
* Adenosine: Lowers Heart Rate

> Morphine should not be administered within 15 minuets of each other.
> Painkillers should not be administered within 5 minutes of each other.


## Vitals

### Blood Pressure (Systolic/Diastolic)

* High: 160/160+
* Normal: 100/160
* Resting: 120/80
* Low: 20/100
* Non-existent: 0/20

Systolic is the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats
Diastolic is the pressure in the arteries when the heart rests between beats



### Heart Rate

* High: 120+
* Normal: 46-119
* Resting: 80
* Low: 45-

Cardiac Arrest can occur when:
* HR 200+
* BP /145+ D & HR 150+
* BP S -40/ & HR 190+
* HR -20
* BP /260+ D

In the event of cardiac arrest, or the patient has no heart rate upon arrival, perform CPR until a stable heart rate is achieved. 
> The heart rate will spike to 33 while CPR is being performed, accurate readings can only be taken while CPR is not in progress.

### Saline

Saline comes in three quantities: 1000ml, 500ml, and 250ml. Each can be used when:
* 1000ml: Patient has **Lost a Fatal Amount of Blood** and blood pressure is extremely low
* 500ml: Patient has **Lost a Large Amount of Blood** and blood pressure is low
* 250ml: Patient has **Lost Some Blood** and blood pressure is slightly low

> Blood pressure is related to Heart Rate, consider this when determining how much saline to transfuse. Too much saline can cause high Blood Pressure.
