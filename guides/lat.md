The area needs to be clear of any people or large obstructions. Do not fire the weapon while against a wall or other structure that will redirect the overpressured air back towards you.

### Callouts

When you begin to prepare the weapon you must make a callout of "Clear Back - [Direction]". The direction should be the direction the rocket will be moving toward. Hold until you hear "Clear Clear Clear". Once ready call "Rocket out" then discharge the weapon. If you will not be discharging the weapon yell "Cancel Cancel Cancel".

Examples

> *LAT*: Clear back - East
> *Rifleman*: Clear Clear Clear
> *LAT*: Rocket out

> *LAT*: Clear back - North West
> *Rifleman*: Clear Clear Clear
> *LAT*: Cancel Cancel Cancel, vehicle moved away
